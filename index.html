        <h2>1. Skills Gap</h2>
        <p>
          The skills gap in Africa is one of the most significant barriers to technology growth. Many educational institutions lack current resources or trained educators in fields such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and software development. Graduates often leave school without the practical experience required in the workplace. Additionally, professional certifications are expensive or unavailable in rural areas, creating inequality in opportunity. Bridging this gap requires modern training, mentorship programs, and remote learning platforms that are affordable and accessible to all.

        <h2>2. Limited Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Reliable infrastructure is a foundation for digital progress, yet many African regions suffer from poor connectivity and frequent power outages. Internet access is often limited or costly, particularly outside major urban areas. These challenges make it difficult for IT professionals to collaborate, deploy applications, or access cloud-based resources. Improvements in national broadband infrastructure, sustainable energy investments, and public-private partnerships are critical to supporting a thriving tech environment.

        <h2>3. Budget and Resources</h2>
        <p>
          Many African tech companies and startups operate with minimal financial support. Budgets are often directed toward immediate business needs, leaving little for employee training, software upgrades, or research and development. This makes it hard to keep up with industry standards. Even government programs designed to support innovation are frequently underfunded or poorly managed. A stronger focus on strategic investment and inclusive policies is necessary to grow a resilient and competitive IT sector.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Brain Drain</h2>
        <p>
          Brain drain is a major concern in Africa's tech community. Talented developers, engineers, and data scientists are often recruited by foreign companies offering better pay, work environments, and opportunities. This constant outflow of skilled professionals leaves a gap in local expertise and hinders the growth of homegrown solutions. To reverse this, African nations must foster an ecosystem where professionals are incentivized to stay, such as better pay, funding for startups, recognition, and platforms for innovation.
